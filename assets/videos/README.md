# Stretching App Video Files

Place your stretch video files in this directory. The app is configured to look for videos with the following filenames:

- forward-backward-bend.mp4
- lean-back.mp4
- arm-circle.mp4
- arm-extension.mp4
- arm-raise.mp4
- tricep-stretch.mp4
- calf-stretch.mp4
- quad-stretch.mp4
- lunge.mp4
- cat-pose.mp4
- childs-pose.mp4
- sphinx.mp4
- side-twist.mp4
- wall-squat.mp4
- dab-stretch.mp4

Each video should demonstrate the corresponding stretch properly and be around 10-30 seconds long for optimal performance.
