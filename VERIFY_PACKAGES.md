# Package Verification

Your package.json file already includes all necessary dependencies for building an APK. Here's a summary of the key packages:

## Navigation Packages
- @react-navigation/native
- @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
- @react-navigation/stack
- react-native-safe-area-context
- react-native-screens

## Media & UI Packages
- @expo/vector-icons
- expo-av (for video playback)
- react-native-webview (for TikTok and YouTube embedding)

## Storage & Networking
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage (for stat tracking)
- @react-native-community/netinfo (for network connectivity detection)

## All dependencies are correctly installed and your package.json looks good to go for building an APK.

## Additional Packages for Building

You'll need to install globally:
```
npm install -g eas-cli
npm install -g expo-cli
```

These will be used for the building process but aren't direct dependencies of your app.
